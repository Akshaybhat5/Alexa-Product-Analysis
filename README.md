Amazon's Alexa product analysis.
Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa, is a virtual assistant AI technology developed by Amazon, first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Amazon Dot, Amazon Studio, and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system [Credit Wikipedia for the above resources].

I've analyzed which Alexa designs are more in trend products and their customer satisfaction review length with unsatisfied customer review length.
I've used Tokenization and Countvectorizer to clean the text and to convert the text into a bunch of numbers. These texture converted numbers are fed to the model to predict customers satisfaction. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and RandomForest Classifier are the algorithms used.
Hereunder are some of the analysis capture,
